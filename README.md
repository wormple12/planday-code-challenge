### Code challenge for applying to Planday
Build a grid view using all the data we’ve provided in "planday-challenge-data.json".

You have full creative freedom – so go wild. There’s a catch though! Try your best to include:

- Pagination
- A search function
- A ‘no results found’ state on search
- Make it accessible and keyboard friendly

Feeling extra fancy? Want to make a lasting impression? Bored and hungry for a challenge? Then go ahead and create your own tile builder using a simple form.
- Inputs could include label, description, and image.

Show us what you got!

Please make sure your solution is accessible online.
